YouTube doesn’t allow users to delete channels from a mobile phone. So, you will have to use a Windows, Mac, Linux, or Chromebook computer to delete your channel.

* When you’re ready, start by opening a web browser on your computer and accessing the YouTube Studio site. Then log in to your YouTube account.

* On the YouTube Studio site, in the sidebar to the left, click **“Settings.”**

* On the **“Settings”** window, from the left sidebar, choose **“Channel.”**

* In the right pane of the **“Settings”** window, click **“Advanced Settings.”**

* Scroll the **“Advanced Settings”** tab all the way down. At the bottom, click **“Remove YouTube Content.”**

* YouTube will open a new tab in your web browser. In this new tab, if you’re asked to enter your YouTube account details, do so and continue.

* You’re now on the **“Remove YouTube Content”** page. Here, select **“I Want to Permanently Delete My Content.”**

* In the expanded menu, enable both checkboxes. Then, at the bottom of the menu, click **“Delete My Content.”**

* On the **“Delete Your Content”** window that opens, type your email address in the text box and then click **“Delete My Content.”**

* YouTube will proceed to delete your channel.

* And you’re all set. If you want to go all the way and delete your Google account, that’s possible as well.
